# Election_Analysis
##Overview of Election Audit: Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis.
*The purpose of this election audit analysis is to use python to run through a dataset and analyze the voting count in specific counties. This is extremely helpful to process vote counts instead of manually recording them.

##Election-Audit Results: Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.
Attached to the Module you will find an image with the results.
*There were 369,711 casted votes.
*Denver county received the largest amount of vote counts (turnout)
*Diana Degette was the candidate winner in the vote election with 73.8% of the votes.

Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.

*I would propose to use this script for most of the counties around the united states but also filtering it by geographical locations to see if the votes are coming from rural areas or metropolitan areas.
* I would propose to use vizualizations to look at vote counts during the election run and see how the vote counts changed based on time.
